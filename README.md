# Getting Started

Bot Bind is not only a platform for creating Discord Bots, but also a community where server owners and addon developers benefit from each other.

Bot Bind uses a modified version of the powerful [Klasa](https://github.com/botbind/klasa) framework for discord.js to run the bots and the addons within it. The addon creation and submission process is quite simple and straight forward. We will guide through the process from start to the end.

::: tip But, what if I don't know Javascript?
All botbind bots run on NodeJS, and we currently only support Javascript for addons.
